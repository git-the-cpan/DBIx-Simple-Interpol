DBIx::Simple::Interpol

The recommended way to use SQL::Interpol is via its DBIx::Simple
integration, which provides an excellent alternative to plain DBI
access.

Ordinarily, the "iquery" method in DBIx::Simple integrates SQL::Interp.
But by loading this module instead (or after) DBIx::Simple, the "iquery"
method will be patched to use SQL::Interpol instead.

This is all there is to this module.
